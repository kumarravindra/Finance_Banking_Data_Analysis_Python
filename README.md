# Finance_Banking_Data_Analysis_Python


Finance Data Analysis
In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices.This project is just meant to practice visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.

We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis.

Get the Data
In this section we will learn how to use pandas to directly read data from Google finance using pandas!

We will need to install pandas-datareader for this to work! Pandas datareader allows us to read stock information directly from the internet. To install use pip install pandas-datareader or other required commands.
